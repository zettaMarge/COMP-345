 If you are running an older version of CONQUEST you may get an 
 'ERROR' message upon opening this map -

 Just click 'OK' and continue on to the game -

 This will not affect your conquest game in any way - 




 
 - more info -

 I have designed a .map file where some territories 'do not' connect to other territories 
 which actually are shown to connect on the .bmp file - 

 You will understand after playing this creative map : )

 Enjoy !
